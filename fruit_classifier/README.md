Check out this cool fruit classifier!

It's been trained using over 800 images for each label using the [IMAGENET](http://www.image-net.org/) dataset.
Currently it's only able to classify apples, oranges, bananas, and blueberries however it's berry easy to add more.

The model was able to achieve and accuracy of about 80% using a convolutional neural network; so there is a lot of room for improvement!

The model is already trained, so you can load the Fruit-CNN.model file and start it right away!
